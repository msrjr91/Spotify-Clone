# Front-end Spotify Clone

This project utilizes the Spotify API to create a web-based Spotify "clone." Users of this application will be able to freely browse Spotify's catelogue of artists, tracks, albums, audiobooks, and more. Users with premium Spotify accounts will be able to login with their account using Spotify authentication to then be able to have additional permissions such as playing songs or even entire albums. This application captures the primary functionality of Spotify-actual, with several exceptions in terms of scope of features and accessibility.
